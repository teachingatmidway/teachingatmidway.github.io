In this project, I rethemed the memory game after the children’s show, Bluey. The show airs in Australia but has gained a lot of popularity here in the US. The changes I made to the project were mostly design-based, but I also added the glow on the hover of the cards. I changed all of the pictures, background colors, fireworks colors, removed the background of the car, and completely changed the login page.
