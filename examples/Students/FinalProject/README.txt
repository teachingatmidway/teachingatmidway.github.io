I took the liberty of improving the prototype of Game4 (timer) to enhance the user experience. The motivation behind this decision was that the prototype initially looked too simple and lacked many features. My goal was to transform it into a truly useful program that people can actually use in their daily lives. In the updated version, I added several new features. These include buttons for quickly increasing and decreasing short periods of time, which allows for more precise control over the timer. The background was redesigned to be more visually appealing, creating a more pleasant atmosphere for the user. Additionally, I incorporated options to stop, restart, and set a specific time that the user can customize to their needs. Also there is alarm sound play so user can be sure he didnt miss timer over. These improvements make the timer more versatile and functional. It can be applied to a variety of everyday tasks, such as tracking when your break is about to end or when your Zoom call is about to start. By making these changes, I aimed to ensure that the program is not just a basic tool but a genuinely useful one, offering a better experience and increasing its chances of being adopted by users for regular use.
