I made my counter halloween theme to fit this upcoming holiday we have coming up. I also chnaged the font to match the spooky 
theme that halloween brings to the month. Instead of having a lower count button and a add count button I decided
just to do addition and subtraction symbols. I also added little pumpkin images to add tothe halloween theme even more.
