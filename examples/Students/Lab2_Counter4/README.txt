The Counter Project is a simple web application that allows users to increment, decrement, and manage a counter value. Users can also log their actions and view a history of changes. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap for responsive design.
This program was created mainly for users who need to count some simple numbers(like board games).

Insert Specific Number: Users can enter a specific number to set the counter.
