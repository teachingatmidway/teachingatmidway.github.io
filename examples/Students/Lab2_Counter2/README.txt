I have created a game out of the counter to create some fun out of clicking and counting the numbers. The goal of the game is to reach 100 or negative 100. 
The changes I made were the background and colors as well as adding new background gifs and counter colors at 100 and -100 and changing the color of the counter every 10 numbers to keep the user engaged. 
I also added a reset button to allow the user to start the count over at 0.
