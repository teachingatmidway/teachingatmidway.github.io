For this project we were given a base counter program, where the count would go up or down by 1 by the click of button. I choose to add more increments, specifically a 5 and 10, as well as a reset button. This makes the program a little more useful as you can restart whenever, and get to specific numbers faster. I altered the UI of the page quite a bit, where I started by changing the background to a radial gradient of gray getting lighter and lighter as it made it to the middle. This helped bring focus to the actual count, which is centered in the middle of the screen. I then choose to put the increments on the side of the container, taking up a lot of the empty room before. This filled up both sides, then used the bottom to add the reset button. This helps with the previous amount of dead space, and makes it look better for how simplistic the design is. I tried to keep the base of the code from the original project, so certain terms and methods was not executed properly. Specifically, I brute forced the JavaScript code for the increments and reset button, making it a bit more sloppy than I would prefer. Overall, I upgraded the UI by making the background more minimalistic and filling up some of the unnecessary dead space.
